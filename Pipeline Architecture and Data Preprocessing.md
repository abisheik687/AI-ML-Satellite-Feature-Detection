# Pipeline Architecture and Data Preprocessing

## Data Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Resolution Harmonization
*   **Purpose:** To ensure all input satellite imagery and DEMs have a consistent spatial resolution for integrated analysis and model training.
*   **Tools/Libraries:** GDAL (for resampling and reprojecting rasters), Rasterio.

### 2. Cloud and Shadow Masking
*   **Purpose:** To identify and mask out areas affected by clouds and cloud shadows, which can interfere with accurate feature extraction.
*   **Tools/Libraries:** Python libraries like `fmask` (if available or similar algorithms), OpenCV (for image processing techniques), scikit-image.

### 3. Co-registration
*   **Purpose:** To precisely align multi-temporal and multi-source satellite datasets to ensure that corresponding pixels refer to the same ground location.
*   **Tools/Libraries:** GDAL (for image alignment and geometric correction), OpenCV (for feature matching algorithms like SIFT/SURF if needed).

### 4. DEM Conditioning
*   **Purpose:** To prepare Digital Elevation Models for hydrological analysis, including filling sinks, removing spurious peaks, and ensuring proper flow direction.
*   **Tools/Libraries:** WhiteboxTools, GRASS GIS (for hydrological functions), ArcPy (if ArcGIS is available, but open-source preferred).

## Overall Pipeline Architecture (High-Level)

### 1. Data Ingestion
*   Acquire multi-source satellite imagery (Sentinel-1/2, Landsat, Resourcesat-2/2A, LISS-IV) and DEMs (SRTM, CartoDEM, ASTER) from specified sources (e.g., Google Earth Engine, ISRO platforms).
*   Reference data (NRSC-GL, GLIMS, ICIMOD, OSM) will also be ingested for training and validation.

### 2. Preprocessing Module
*   Apply resolution harmonization, cloud/shadow masking, co-registration, and DEM conditioning as detailed above.
*   Output cleaned, aligned, and ready-to-use geospatial data cubes.

### 3. Feature-Specific Deep Learning Models
*   **Glacial Lakes:** U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SAM for segmentation of water bodies. Temporal analysis module to track changes.
*   **Road Centrelines:** U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SAM for initial road segmentation, followed by post-processing (skeletonization) for centerline extraction.
*   **Urban Drainage Systems:** Hydrological modeling on conditioned DEMs (e.g., flow accumulation, stream order) combined with ML-based classification (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) using satellite imagery features to delineate connected stream networks.

### 4. Post-processing and Vectorization
*   Apply morphological operations, skeletonization (for roads), and other image processing techniques to refine extracted features.
*   Convert raster outputs from segmentation models into vector formats (Shapefile, GeoJSON) suitable for GIS applications.

### 5. Validation and Evaluation
*   Compare extracted features against authoritative reference datasets using metrics like IoU, buffer overlap accuracy, completeness, and robustness.
*   Perform visual inspection and qualitative assessment.

### 6. Output Generation and Dissemination
*   Generate final Shapefiles/GeoJSON for glacial lakes (with temporal change maps), road centrelines, and urban drainage networks.
*   Develop interactive performance dashboards (Streamlit/Dash) to visualize model accuracy, scalability, and inference capabilities.

### 7. Deployment
*   Package the entire pipeline as a modular and reusable toolkit for environmental monitoring, disaster preparedness, and smart infrastructure planning.
