# Interactive Dashboard Development

## 1. Dashboard Layout and User Interface Design

### a. Main Dashboard Components
*   **Header Section:**
    *   Project title: "AI/ML-Powered Geospatial Analysis Pipeline"
    *   Navigation menu with sections for each feature type (Glacial Lakes, Road Centrelines, Urban Drainage)
    *   Real-time status indicators showing pipeline health and processing status

*   **Feature-Specific Sections:**
    *   **Glacial Lakes Panel:**
        *   Interactive map displaying detected glacial lakes with temporal slider
        *   Metrics panel showing detection accuracy, lake count, and area statistics
        *   Temporal change visualization (charts showing lake area evolution over time)
    *   **Road Centrelines Panel:**
        *   Interactive map with road network overlay
        *   Metrics panel displaying completeness, connectivity, and buffer overlap accuracy
        *   Comparison view between extracted centrelines and reference data
    *   **Urban Drainage Panel:**
        *   Interactive map showing drainage networks and stream connectivity
        *   Hydrological analysis results with flow direction and accumulation visualizations
        *   Validation metrics against reference drainage datasets

*   **Performance Analytics Section:**
    *   Model accuracy metrics dashboard with interactive charts
    *   Computational efficiency metrics (runtime, memory usage, inference speed)
    *   Scalability assessment results across different geographic regions

### b. User Interface Design Principles
*   **Modern and Professional:** Clean, minimalist design with consistent color scheme and typography
*   **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects, smooth transitions, and responsive design
*   **Data Visualization:** Rich charts and maps using libraries like Plotly, Leaflet, or Mapbox
*   **Accessibility:** Proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

## 2. Interactive Features

### a. Map Interactions
*   **Zoom and Pan:** Users can navigate through different geographic regions
*   **Layer Toggle:** Switch between different data layers (satellite imagery, extracted features, reference data)
*   **Feature Selection:** Click on detected features to view detailed information and metadata
*   **Temporal Controls:** Time slider for viewing changes in glacial lakes over time

### b. Data Visualization
*   **Dynamic Charts:** Interactive plots showing validation metrics, temporal trends, and performance statistics
*   **Comparison Tools:** Side-by-side views comparing model outputs with ground truth data
*   **Export Functionality:** Download extracted features as Shapefiles or GeoJSON
*   **Real-time Updates:** Live updates of processing status and newly processed regions

### c. Analysis Tools
*   **Region Selection:** Users can define custom areas of interest for analysis
*   **Batch Processing:** Interface for processing multiple satellite images or time series
*   **Model Configuration:** Options to adjust model parameters and preprocessing settings

## 3. Web Application Implementation

### a. Technology Stack Options

#### Option 1: Streamlit (Recommended for Rapid Prototyping)
*   **Advantages:** Quick development, built-in widgets, easy integration with Python ML libraries
*   **Components:**
    *   `streamlit-folium` for interactive maps
    *   `plotly` for interactive charts and visualizations
    *   `streamlit-aggrid` for data tables
    *   Custom CSS for styling and branding

#### Option 2: React (Recommended for Production)
*   **Advantages:** More flexible, better performance, professional UI components
*   **Components:**
    *   React with TypeScript for type safety
    *   Tailwind CSS for styling
    *   Recharts for data visualization
    *   Leaflet or Mapbox for interactive maps
    *   Shadcn/ui for modern UI components

### b. Backend Integration
*   **API Development:** RESTful API using Flask or FastAPI to serve model predictions and data
*   **Database Integration:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS for storing geospatial data and results
*   **File Management:** Secure file upload and download functionality for satellite imagery and outputs

### c. Deployment Considerations
*   **Containerization:** Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments
*   **Cloud Deployment:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable hosting
*   **Performance Optimization:** Caching strategies, CDN integration, and lazy loading for large datasets
*   **Security:** Authentication, authorization, and secure data handling practices
