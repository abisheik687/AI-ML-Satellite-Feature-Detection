# Deep Learning Model Implementation

## 1. Deep Learning Architectures per Feature Type

### a. Glacial Lakes Detection and Delineation
*   **Primary Architecture:** U-Net and DeepLabV3+.
    *   **U-Net:** Excellent for semantic segmentation tasks, especially with limited training data, due to its U-shaped architecture with skip connections that preserve fine-grained details.
    *   **DeepLabV3+:** Offers improved performance by incorporating atrous convolution with multiple rates to capture multi-scale context, and an encoder-decoder structure for sharper boundaries.
*   **Complementary Model:** SAM (Segment Anything Model).
    *   **SAM:** Can be used for zero-shot or few-shot segmentation, particularly useful for identifying new or unusual glacial lake formations. Its promptable interface can assist in refining segmentation masks.

### b. Road Centrelines Extraction
*   **Primary Architecture:** U-Net and DeepLabV3+.
    *   These models will be used for initial semantic segmentation of road pixels.
*   **Post-processing:** The segmented road masks will then undergo skeletonization techniques (e.g., using `skimage.morphology.skeletonize`) to extract continuous centrelines.

### c. Urban Drainage Systems Delineation
*   **Approach:** A hybrid approach combining hydrological modeling with ML-based classification.
*   **Hydrological Modeling (on DEMs):**
    *   **Tools:** WhiteboxTools or GRASS GIS for deriving flow direction, flow accumulation, and stream networks from conditioned DEMs.
*   **ML-based Classification (on Satellite Imagery Features):**
    *   **Models:** Random Forest or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
    *   **Features:** Spectral indices (e.g., NDWI for water bodies), texture features, and topographic features derived from DEMs (e.g., slope, aspect, curvature).
    *   **Integration:** The outputs from hydrological modeling will be refined and validated using the ML-based classification results to delineate connected stream networks.

## 2. Training Methodology

### a. Data Splitting
*   **Training Set:** Approximately 70-80% of the prepared and labeled dataset for model training.
*   **Validation Set:** Approximately 10-15% for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping.
*   **Test Set:** Approximately 10-15% for final model evaluation on unseen data.

### b. Data Augmentation
*   **Purpose:** To increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization, especially given the variability in satellite imagery (e.g., lighting, atmospheric conditions, terrain).
*   **Techniques:** Random rotations, flips (horizontal/vertical), brightness adjustments, contrast adjustments, Gaussian blur, and elastic deformations.

### c. Loss Functions
*   **For Segmentation Models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SAM):**
    *   **Dice Loss:** Effective for highly imbalanced datasets (e.g., small features like roads or lakes).
    *   **Focal Loss:** Addresses class imbalance by down-weighting easy examples and focusing on hard, misclassified examples.
    *   **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss:** Often combined with Dice Loss for robust performance.
*   **For Classification Models (Random Forest, SVM):** Standard classification loss functions appropriate for the chosen framework.

### d. Optimization Strategies
*   **Optimizer:** Adam or RMSprop for deep learning models, known for their adaptive learning rates and good performance.
*   **Learning Rate Schedule:** Cosine annealing or ReduceLROnPlateau to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.
*   **Batch Size:** Determined based on available GPU memory and dataset characteristics.
*   **Early Stopping:** Monitor validation loss and stop training if it doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs to prevent overfitting.

## 3. Frameworks and Libraries

*   **Deep Learning Frameworks:**
    *   **TensorFlow/Keras:** A high-level API for building and training deep learning models, offering flexibility and scalability.
    *   **PyTorch:** A more Pythonic and flexible framework, popular for research and rapid prototyping.
*   **Geospatial Libraries:**
    *   **GDAL/OGR:** For reading, writing, and manipulating raster and vector geospatial data.
    *   **Rasterio:** For efficient raster I/O and manipulation.
    *   **GeoPandas:** For working with geospatial vector data (Shapefiles, GeoJSON) in a Pandas-like DataFrame structure.
*   **Image Processing Libraries:**
    *   **OpenCV:** For general image processing tasks, including morphological operations.
    *   **scikit-image:** For advanced image processing, including skeletonization.
*   **Numerical Computing:**
    *   **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
*   **Data Visualization:**
    *   **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** For plotting training metrics and visualizing results.
